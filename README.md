# Reddit Enhancer

A browser extension to tweak the user interface on Reddit.

Supports Old, "Old New" and "New New" versions of Reddit. Not all features support all versions however.

Feel free to suggest new features and report any bugs on the Issues page.

Some features may stop working due to website updates. Please let me know if you find any issues.

I welcome any help if you would like to improve or contribute new language translations. [Completion List](#localisation)
