I welcome any help to improve translations, fix mistakes or add new languages.

To add a new language, duplicate the "en" directory, and rename it with the two letter language code of the new language, then translate the "message" values.
Regional localisations can be added also by appending the region code. For example, "en_GB" for British English.
Any missing translations in regional files will fall back to the main language, so only differences are required.
The "extensionVersion" item can be deleted.

If you're unsure how to do this, open an issue and I'll help.

Thank you :)
